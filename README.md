## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Discussion

Bully Book Club is an Instagram book club that reviews a book once a month on Instagram. Members post a photo of the book with their bulldog with a review and use hashtags to drive up the visibility of the chosen book, author and publisher on that day. 

Due to a recent growth in membership and personal commitments, the owner of bully book club is spending a large amount of time answering questions from users asking what the book club is reading and how to participate.

#### Key information for the site:

* What is the current months book.
* What are the next books.
* How to become a member and take part.
* A way for people to contact the book club with questions and recommendations. 
* Updates on what is coming to the book club in 2022.
