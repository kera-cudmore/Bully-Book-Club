            <div class="card-title book-title">Taste</div>
            <div class="card-title book-author">Stanley Tucci</div>
            <p class="card-text">From award-winning actor and food obsessive Stanley Tucci comes an
              intimate and
              charming memoir of life in and out of the kitchen.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Stanley Tucci grew up in an Italian American family that spent every night around the
              kitchen table. He shared the magic of those meals with us in The Tucci Cookbook and The Tucci Table, and
              now he takes us beyond the savoury recipes and into the compelling stories behind them.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Taste is a reflection on the intersection of food and life, filled with antecdotes
              about his growing up in Westchester, New York; preparing for and shooting the foodie films Big Night and
              Julie & Julia; falling in love over dinner; and teaming up with his wife to create meals for a multitude
              of children. Each morsel of this gastronomic journey through good times and bad, five-star meals and
              burned dishes, is as heartfelt and delicious as the last.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Written with Stanley's signature wry humour, Taste is for fans of Bill Buford,
              Gabrielle Hamilton and Ruth Reichl - and anyone who knows the power of a home-cooked meal.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Welcome to Runway Magazine - and the office of Miranda Priestly...</p>
            <p class="card-text">When Andrea first sets foot in the plush Manhattan offices of Runway she knows
              nothing. She's never heard of the world's most fashionable magazine, or its feared editor, Miranda
              Priestly.</p>
            <p class="card-text">A year later, Andy knows altogether too much:</p>
            <p class="card-text">That it's a sacking offence to wear anything lower than a three-inch heel to work.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">That you can charge cars, manicures, anything at all to the Runway account, but you
              must never, ever, leave your desk, or let Miranda's coffee get cold.</p>
            <p class="card-text">And that at 3am, when your boyfriend's dumping you and your best friend's just been
              arrested, if Miranda phones, you jump.</p>
            <p class="card-text">But most of all Andy knows this is her big break, and it's going to be worth it in
              the end. Isn't it?</p>

            <p class="card-text">Patricia Campbell’s life has never felt smaller. Her husband is a workaholic, her
              teenage kids have their own lives, her senile mother-in-law needs constant care, and she’s always a step
              behind on her endless to-do list. The only thing keeping her sane is her book club, a close-knit group
              of Charleston women united by their love of true crime. At these meetings they’re as likely to talk
              about the Manson family as they are about their own families.</p>
            <p class="card-text">One evening after book club, Patricia is viciously attacked by an elderly neighbour,
              bringing the neighbour’s handsome nephew, James Harris, into her life. James is well travelled and well
              read, and he makes Patricia feel things she hasn’t felt in years. But when children on the other side of
              town go missing, their deaths written off by local police, Patricia has reason to believe James Harris
              is more of a Bundy than a Brad Pitt. The real problem? James is a monster of a different kind—and
              Patricia has already invited him in. </p>
            <p class="card-text">Little by little, James will insinuate himself into Patricia’s life and try to take
              everything she took for granted—including the book club—but she won’t surrender without a fight in this
              blood-soaked tale of neighbourly kindness gone wrong.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Before Owen Michaels disappears, he smuggles a note to his beloved wife of one year:
              Protect her. Despite her confusion and fear, Hannah Hall knows exactly to whom the note refers—Owen’s
              sixteen-year-old daughter, Bailey. Bailey, who lost her mother tragically as a child. Bailey, who wants
              absolutely nothing to do with her new stepmother.</p>
            <p class="card-text">As Hannah’s increasingly desperate calls to Owen go unanswered, as the FBI arrests
              Owen’s boss, as a US marshal and federal agents arrive at her Sausalito home unannounced, Hannah quickly
              realizes her husband isn’t who he said he was. And that Bailey just may hold the key to figuring out
              Owen’s true identity—and why he really disappeared.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Hannah and Bailey set out to discover the truth. But as they start putting together
              the pieces of Owen’s past, they soon realize they’re also building a new future—one neither of them
              could have anticipated.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Pretty and popular high school senior Andie Bell was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal
              Singh, who then killed himself. It was all anyone could talk about. And five years later, Pip sees how
              the tragedy still haunts her town.</p>
            <p class="card-text">But she can’t shake the feeling that there was more to what happened that day. She
              knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. How could he possibly have been a
              killer?</p>
            <p class="card-text">Now a senior herself, Pip decides to re-examine the closed case for her final
              project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation. But soon she discovers a trail of
              dark secrets that might actually prove Sal innocent . . . and the line between past and present begins
              to blur. Someone in Fairview doesn’t want Pip digging around for answers, and now her own life might be
              in danger.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Twenty-six-year-old editorial assistant Nella Rogers is tired of being the only Black
              employee at Wagner Books. Fed up with the isolation and the micro-aggressions, she's thrilled when Hazel
              starts working in the cubicle beside hers. They've only just started comparing natural hair care
              regimens, though, when a string of uncomfortable events cause Nella to become Public Enemy Number One
              and Hazel, the Office Darling.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Then the notes begin to appear on Nella's desk: LEAVE WAGNER. NOW.</p>
            <p class="card-text">It's hard to believe Hazel is behind these hostile messages. But as Nella starts to
              spiral and obsess over the sinister forces at play, she soon realises that there is a lot more at stake
              than her career.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Dark, funny and furiously entertaining, The Other Black Girl will keep you on the
              edge of your seat until the very last twist.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. All the slaves lead a hellish
              existence, but Cora has it worse than most; she is an outcast even among her fellow Africans and she
              is approaching womanhood, where it is clear even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a slave recently
              arrived from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they take the perilous decision to
              escape to the North.</p>
            <p class="card-text">In Whitehead’s razor-sharp imagining of the antebellum South, the Underground
              Railroad has assumed a physical form: a dilapidated box car pulled along subterranean tracks by a
              steam locomotive, picking up fugitives wherever it can. Cora and Caesar’s first stop is South
              Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But its placid surface masks an infernal scheme
              designed for its unknowing black inhabitants. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher
              sent to find Cora, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight,
              state by state, seeking true freedom.</p>
            <p class="card-text">At each stop on her journey, Cora encounters a different world. As Whitehead
              brilliantly recreates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative
              seamlessly weaves the saga of America, from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled
              promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is at once the story of one woman’s ferocious
              will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shatteringly powerful meditation on history.</p>

            <p class="card-text">In the ballrooms and drawing rooms of Regency London, rules abound. From their
              earliest days, children of aristocrats learn how to address an earl and curtsey before a prince—while
              other dictates of the ton are unspoken yet universally understood. A proper duke should be imperious and
              aloof. A young, marriageable lady should be amiable… but not too amiable.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Daphne Bridgerton has always failed at the latter. The fourth of eight siblings in
              her close-knit family, she has formed friendships with the most eligible young men in London. Everyone
              likes Daphne for her kindness and wit. But no one truly desires her. She is simply too deuced honest for
              that, too unwilling to play the romantic games that captivate gentlemen.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Amiability is not a characteristic shared by Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings. Recently
              returned to England from abroad, he intends to shun both marriage and society—just as his callous father
              shunned Simon throughout his painful childhood. Yet an encounter with his best friend’s sister offers
              another option. If Daphne agrees to a fake courtship, Simon can deter the mamas who parade their
              daughters before him. Daphne, meanwhile, will see her prospects and her reputation soar.</p>
            <p class="card-text">The plan works like a charm—at first. But amid the glittering, gossipy, cut-throat
              world of London’s elite, there is only one certainty: love ignores every rule...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Barcelona, 1945—just after the war, a great world city lies in shadow, nursing its
              wounds, and a boy named Daniel awakes on his eleventh birthday to find that he can no longer remember
              his mother’s face. </p>
            <p class="card-text">To console his only child, Daniel’s widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer,
              initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona’s guild
              of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care
              about them again.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Daniel’s father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiralling labyrinth of
              shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he
              selects, The Shadow of the Wind by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax’s work.
              To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this
              author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of
              Barcelona’s darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he
              realizes that if he doesn’t find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will
              suffer horribly.</p>

              the best way to move a body (wrap it in sheets like a mummy), and she keeps Ayoola from posting pictures
              to Instagram when she should be mourning her “missing” boyfriend. Not that she gets any credit.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Korede has long been in love with a kind, handsome doctor at the hospital where she
              works. She dreams of the day when he will realize that she’s exactly what he needs. But when he asks
              Korede for Ayoola’s phone number, she must reckon with what her sister has become and how far she’s
              willing to go to protect her.

            <p class="card-text">According to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch (the world's only
              completely accurate book of prophecies, written in 1655, before she exploded), the world will end on a
              Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. Just before dinner.</p>

              tempers are flaring. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan. Except a somewhat fussy
              angel and a fast-living demon—both of whom have lived amongst Earth's mortals since The Beginning and have
              grown rather fond of the lifestyle—are not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Willow Moss, the youngest and least powerful sister in a family of witches, has a
              magical ability for finding lost things – like keys, or socks, or spectacles. Useful, but not exactly
              exciting...</p>
            <p class="card-text">Then the most powerful witch in the world of Starfell turns up at Willow’s door and
              asks for her help. A whole day – last Tuesday to be precise – has gone missing. Completely. And without it
              the whole universe could unravel.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Now Willow holds the fate of Starfell in her rather unremarkable hands… Can she save
              the day – by finding the lost one?</p>

            <p class="card-text">In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born.
              But Circe is a strange child — not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother.
              Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power — the power
              of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft,
              tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including
              the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.</p>
            <p class="card-text">But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the
              wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and
              vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose,
              once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.

              Games.</p>
            <p class="card-text">The once-mighty house of Snow has fallen on hard times, its fate hanging on the slender
              chance that Coriolanus will be able to outcharm, outwit, and outmaneuver his fellow students to mentor the
              winning tribute. The odds are against him. He's been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the
              female tribute from District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are now completely intertwined - every
              choice Coriolanus makes could lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts
              to feel for his doomed tribute... and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to
              survive no matter what it takes.</p>

              alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery,
              unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first.</p>
            <p class="card-text">But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering
              skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable
              obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?

            <p class="card-text">Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show
              began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at
              a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’
              indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and
              often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him
              away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set
              forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a
              centuries-long struggle.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young
              man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story
              of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his
              teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would
              ultimately threaten her own life.</p>
            <p class="card-text">The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting.
              Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an
              attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school,
              Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave
              together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in
              a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother’s unconventional, unconditional love.

            <p class="card-text">During the languid days of the Christmas break, a group of thirtysomething friends from
              Oxford meet to welcome in the New Year together, a tradition they began as students ten years ago. For
              this vacation, they’ve chosen an idyllic and isolated estate in the Scottish Highlands—the perfect place
              to get away and unwind by themselves.</p>
            <p class="card-text">The trip began innocently enough: admiring the stunning if foreboding scenery,
              champagne in front of a crackling fire, and reminiscences about the past. But after a decade, the weight
              of secret resentments has grown too heavy for the group’s tenuous nostalgia to bear. Amid the boisterous
              revelry of New Year’s Eve, the cord holding them together snaps.</p>

            <p class="card-text">There used to be an empty chair at the back of Mrs. Khan’s classroom, but on the third
              Tuesday of the school year a new kid fills it: nine-year-old Ahmet, a Syrian refugee. The whole class is
              curious about this new boy–he doesn’t seem to smile, and he doesn’t talk much. But after learning that
              Ahmet fled a Very Real War” and was separated from his family along the way, a determined group of his
              classmates band together to concoct the Greatest Idea in the World–a magnificent plan to reunite Ahmet
              with his loved ones.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Balancing humor and heart, this relatable story about the refugee crisis from the
              perspective of kids highlights the community-changing potential of standing as an ally and reminds readers
              that everyone deserves a place to call home.</p>

              Nicholas Young, she envisions a humble family home and quality time with the man she hopes to marry. But
              Nick has failed to give his girlfriend a few key details. One, that his childhood home looks like a
              palace; two, that he grew up riding in more private planes than cars; and three, that he just happens to
              be the country’s most eligible bachelor.</p>
            <p class="card-text">On Nick’s arm, Rachel may as well have a target on her back the second she steps off
              the plane, and soon, her relaxed vacation turns into an obstacle course of old money, new money, nosy
              relatives, and scheming social climbers.</p>

              the usual calls from drunks and wrong numbers. But then a report of an attempted abduction catches her
              eye. The only thing is that it was flagged as a false alarm just fifteen minutes later. But Harper chooses
              to investigate anyway.</p>
