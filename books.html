            <h6 class="card-title">Stanley Tucci</h6>
            <p class="card-text">From award-winning actor and food obsessive Stanley Tucci comes an
              intimate and
              charming memoir of life in and out of the kitchen.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Stanley Tucci grew up in an Italian American family that spent every night around the
              kitchen table. He shared the magic of those meals with us in The Tucci Cookbook and The Tucci Table, and
              now he takes us beyond the savoury recipes and into the compelling stories behind them.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Taste is a reflection on the intersection of food and life, filled with antecdotes
              about his growing up in Westchester, New York; preparing for and shooting the foodie films Big Night and
              Julie & Julia; falling in love over dinner; and teaming up with his wife to create meals for a multitude
              of children. Each morsel of this gastronomic journey through good times and bad, five-star meals and
              burned dishes, is as heartfelt and delicious as the last.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Written with Stanley's signature wry humour, Taste is for fans of Bill Buford,
              Gabrielle Hamilton and Ruth Reichl - and anyone who knows the power of a home-cooked meal.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Welcome to Runway Magazine - and the office of Miranda Priestly...</p>
            <p class="card-text">When Andrea first sets foot in the plush Manhattan offices of Runway she knows
              nothing. She's never heard of the world's most fashionable magazine, or its feared editor, Miranda
              Priestly.</p>
            <p class="card-text">A year later, Andy knows altogether too much:</p>
            <p class="card-text">That it's a sacking offence to wear anything lower than a three-inch heel to work.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">That you can charge cars, manicures, anything at all to the Runway account, but you
              must never, ever, leave your desk, or let Miranda's coffee get cold.</p>
            <p class="card-text">And that at 3am, when your boyfriend's dumping you and your best friend's just been
              arrested, if Miranda phones, you jump.</p>
            <p class="card-text">But most of all Andy knows this is her big break, and it's going to be worth it in
              the end. Isn't it?</p>

            <p class="card-text">Patricia Campbell’s life has never felt smaller. Her husband is a workaholic, her
              teenage kids have their own lives, her senile mother-in-law needs constant care, and she’s always a step
              behind on her endless to-do list. The only thing keeping her sane is her book club, a close-knit group
              of Charleston women united by their love of true crime. At these meetings they’re as likely to talk
              about the Manson family as they are about their own families.</p>
            <p class="card-text">One evening after book club, Patricia is viciously attacked by an elderly neighbour,
              bringing the neighbour’s handsome nephew, James Harris, into her life. James is well travelled and well
              read, and he makes Patricia feel things she hasn’t felt in years. But when children on the other side of
              town go missing, their deaths written off by local police, Patricia has reason to believe James Harris
              is more of a Bundy than a Brad Pitt. The real problem? James is a monster of a different kind—and
              Patricia has already invited him in. </p>
            <p class="card-text">Little by little, James will insinuate himself into Patricia’s life and try to take
              everything she took for granted—including the book club—but she won’t surrender without a fight in this
              blood-soaked tale of neighbourly kindness gone wrong.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Before Owen Michaels disappears, he smuggles a note to his beloved wife of one year:
              Protect her. Despite her confusion and fear, Hannah Hall knows exactly to whom the note refers—Owen’s
              sixteen-year-old daughter, Bailey. Bailey, who lost her mother tragically as a child. Bailey, who wants
              absolutely nothing to do with her new stepmother.</p>
            <p class="card-text">As Hannah’s increasingly desperate calls to Owen go unanswered, as the FBI arrests
              Owen’s boss, as a US marshal and federal agents arrive at her Sausalito home unannounced, Hannah quickly
              realizes her husband isn’t who he said he was. And that Bailey just may hold the key to figuring out
              Owen’s true identity—and why he really disappeared.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Hannah and Bailey set out to discover the truth. But as they start putting together
              the pieces of Owen’s past, they soon realize they’re also building a new future—one neither of them
              could have anticipated.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Pretty and popular high school senior Andie Bell was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal
              Singh, who then killed himself. It was all anyone could talk about. And five years later, Pip sees how
              the tragedy still haunts her town.</p>
            <p class="card-text">But she can’t shake the feeling that there was more to what happened that day. She
              knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. How could he possibly have been a
              killer?</p>
            <p class="card-text">Now a senior herself, Pip decides to re-examine the closed case for her final
              project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation. But soon she discovers a trail of
              dark secrets that might actually prove Sal innocent . . . and the line between past and present begins
              to blur. Someone in Fairview doesn’t want Pip digging around for answers, and now her own life might be
              in danger.</p>

              starts working in the cubicle beside hers. They've only just started comparing natural hair care
              regimens, though, when a string of uncomfortable events cause Nella to become Public Enemy Number One

            <h6 class="card-title">Colson Whitehead</h6>
            <p class="card-text">Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. All the slaves lead a hellish
              existence, but Cora has it worse than most; she is an outcast even among her fellow Africans and she
              is approaching womanhood, where it is clear even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a slave recently
              arrived from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they take the perilous decision to
              escape to the North.</p>
            <p class="card-text">In Whitehead’s razor-sharp imagining of the antebellum South, the Underground
              Railroad has assumed a physical form: a dilapidated box car pulled along subterranean tracks by a
              steam locomotive, picking up fugitives wherever it can. Cora and Caesar’s first stop is South
              Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But its placid surface masks an infernal scheme
              designed for its unknowing black inhabitants. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher
              sent to find Cora, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight,
              state by state, seeking true freedom.</p>
            <p class="card-text">At each stop on her journey, Cora encounters a different world. As Whitehead
              brilliantly recreates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative
              seamlessly weaves the saga of America, from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled
              promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is at once the story of one woman’s ferocious
              will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shatteringly powerful meditation on history.</p>

            <p class="card-text">In the ballrooms and drawing rooms of Regency London, rules abound. From their
              earliest days, children of aristocrats learn how to address an earl and curtsey before a prince—while
              other dictates of the ton are unspoken yet universally understood. A proper duke should be imperious and
              aloof. A young, marriageable lady should be amiable… but not too amiable.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Daphne Bridgerton has always failed at the latter. The fourth of eight siblings in
              her close-knit family, she has formed friendships with the most eligible young men in London. Everyone
              likes Daphne for her kindness and wit. But no one truly desires her. She is simply too deuced honest for
              that, too unwilling to play the romantic games that captivate gentlemen.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Amiability is not a characteristic shared by Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings. Recently
              returned to England from abroad, he intends to shun both marriage and society—just as his callous father
              shunned Simon throughout his painful childhood. Yet an encounter with his best friend’s sister offers
              another option. If Daphne agrees to a fake courtship, Simon can deter the mamas who parade their
              daughters before him. Daphne, meanwhile, will see her prospects and her reputation soar.</p>
            <p class="card-text">The plan works like a charm—at first. But amid the glittering, gossipy, cut-throat
              world of London’s elite, there is only one certainty: love ignores every rule...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Barcelona, 1945—just after the war, a great world city lies in shadow, nursing its
              wounds, and a boy named Daniel awakes on his eleventh birthday to find that he can no longer remember
              his mother’s face. </p>
            <p class="card-text">To console his only child, Daniel’s widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer,
              initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona’s guild
              of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care
              about them again.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Daniel’s father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiralling labyrinth of
              shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he
              selects, The Shadow of the Wind by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax’s work.
              To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this
              author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of
              Barcelona’s darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he
              realizes that if he doesn’t find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will
              suffer horribly.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Korede’s sister Ayoola is many things: the favorite child, the beautiful one,
              possibly sociopathic. And now Ayoola’s third boyfriend in a row is dead, stabbed through the heart with
              Ayoola’s knife. Korede’s practicality is the sisters’ saving grace.</p>
            <p class="card-text">She knows the best solutions for cleaning blood (bleach, bleach, and more bleach),
              the best way to move a body (wrap it in sheets like a mummy), and she keeps Ayoola from posting pictures
              to Instagram when she should be mourning her “missing” boyfriend. Not that she gets any credit.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Korede has long been in love with a kind, handsome doctor at the hospital where she
              works. She dreams of the day when he will realize that she’s exactly what he needs. But when he asks
              Korede for Ayoola’s phone number, she must reckon with what her sister has become and how far she’s
              willing to go to protect her.

            <p class="card-text">Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on
              forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would
              be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to
              undo your regrets?</p>
            <p class="card-text">Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an
              infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it
              is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice
              at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance
              to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?</p>
            <p class="card-text">In The Midnight Library, Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with
              the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups,
              realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through
              the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the
              first place.</p>
